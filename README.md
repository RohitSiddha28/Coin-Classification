# Coin-Classification

We aim to make an accurate image classification model which accurately identifies the type of
coin and the country of origin of a coin from just one image. There are 315 unique classes of
coins in the dataset and each class symbolises a unique combination of currency, value, and
country (e.g. "Euro,50 cents, Finland" or "Pakistani Rupee,1 Paisa, Pakistan").
This project was a competition, created as part of the Deep Learning for Computer Vision
course at the University of Tartu.
The aim is to train a computer vision model that can precisely identify the specific coin shown
in image. The collection of coins is quite diverse : from euros with different national designs to
Estonian kroons, Pakistani rupees and many others.
Most images show a single coin, although in some cases, both the front and back sides are
visible. This adds complexity to the classification, as important details, whether on the obverse
or reverse, can be crucial to distinguish between coins that look very similar in shape.
